# Lesson 4.2: Writing documents with LaTeX
*In this lesson you will learn how create documents with LaTeX*

LaTeX is a popular document preparation system that is used extensively in for example exact sciences to write papers and reports. It is also possible to create posters and slide shows with it. Its main advantage over for example Microsoft Word and Microsoft Powerpoint is that the layout of the documents are automatically taken care of during the creation of your documents. It also automatically correctly numbers chapters, sections, figures, tables and so on, allowing you to fully focus on the contents of the document. The downside is that LaTeX documents are written in a special syntax, which is then *compiled* to the target document type (like .pdf). This makes LaTeX more difficult to use then Word.

In this short section I don't want to give an introduction into LaTeX, there other places on the internet where a way better introduction can be found than one that I could give here. See for example [https://www.latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/](https://www.latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/) or [https://www.tug.org/twg/mactex/tutorials/ltxprimer-1.0.pdf](https://www.tug.org/twg/mactex/tutorials/ltxprimer-1.0.pdf). If you are just interested in *using* LaTeX and are not interested in actually having it run on your own computer, I do recommend you look out [https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials). Overleaf is a website on which you can write your LaTeX documents and also compile them. It is essentially a cloud storage for your documents, allowing you to access your documents from any computer.

However, if you *are* interested in compiling your own documents yourself, I recommend you use the `pdflatex` command, followed by the main file of the document you want to compile.

```
pdflatex main.tex
```

This command compiles your .tex file to a .pdf file. As said, this compilation process automatically takes care of the numbering of chapters and is also able to create overviews like a table of contents based on your document. It does this however based on the *previous* compilation of the document. To get everything working right, you might have to compile your document twice.

But that might not be all you have to do. If you are using a bibtex bibliography, you also have to run the `bibtex` command. All in all, your list of commands will probably be something like this:

```
pdflatex main.tex
bibtex main.tex
pdflatex main.tex
pdflatex main.tex
```

## Exercises
1. Download the [main.tex](files/main.tex) file from the files folder. It does not contain any bibtex. Compile it once and view the document. Is something off?
2. Compile the document again and check it out again.
