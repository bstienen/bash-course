# Lesson 3.4: Keyboard tricks
*In this lesson you will learn how you can use your keyboard to make actually using the terminal easier.*

This section will be a nice short one and if you don't like making exercises, you will be glad to hear that there will be no exercises for this section. The reason for this is that we will just look at a list of possibly nice tricks you can perform with a couple of keyboard inputs to make navigation in the terminal easier. This is something you just have to *do*. See this section therefore more as a list for future reference if you ever wonder "how did i do X again?".

## Navigation in a single line
| Shortcut      | Effect        |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| `CTRL + A`    | Move the cursor to the beginning of the line |
| `CTRL + E`    | Move the cursor to the end of the line |
| `ALT + F`     | Move the cursor to the next word |
| `ALT + B`     | Move the cursor to the previous word |

## Copy and pasting
| Shortcut      | Effect        |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| `CTRL + K`            | Cut text from cursor to the end of the line |
| `CTRL + U`            | Cut text from beginning of the line to the cursor |
| `ALT + D`             | Cut next word |
| `ALT + backspace`     | Cut current word (this can be the previous word if the cursor is at the end of the word) |
| `CTRL + Y`            | Paste cut text |

## Navigation in your history
| Shortcut      | Effect        |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| `up arrow`    | Get previous command `history` (works recursively) |
| `down arrow`  | Get next command in `history` (works recursively) |
| `CTRL + R`    | Open an interactive search for a command in the `history` |
| `CTRL + L`    | Clear the screen (shortcut for the `clear` command) |
