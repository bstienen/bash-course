# Lesson 01: Your first command
*In this lesson you will learn how to open the terminal and how to use commands*

## Opening the terminal
Let us start with the basics: opening the terminal. The graphical way of doing this is to click the Ubuntu icon on the top of your doc. This is probably located at the left of your screen. If it is located at the bottom of your screen, the Ubuntu icon is located at the left side of the doc. In the search field that appears after clicking the logo, type `terminal` and click the icon with the silver framed black box called `Terminal`.

A slightly faster way of opening the terminal is to press the Windows key on your keyboard. This immediately opens the search window and focuses your cursor in the search bar.

But without a doubt the fastest way of opening the terminal is via the key combination `CTRL + ALT + T`. I recommend you to remember this key combination: it saves you three precious seconds of your life every time you want to open a terminal.

## What do you see exactly?
In the terminal you can execute commands to run programs. These programs can manipulate files, change settings on your computer, perform calculations, etc. Anything you can do with a program with a graphical interface can also be done (at least in principle) through commands in the terminal.

The terminal itself serves two purposes. The first one is allowing the user to enter commands for the computer to execute. The blinking cursor in your terminal is essentially the same as the genie from Aladdin saying "What is your wish master": you give it a command, the computer executes it.

The second purpose of the terminal is to show the output of the command. Not all commands provide output, but the ones that do will do this most of the time directly to the terminal. Not that all this output is necessarily useful: often it is just there for *possible* future reference and to make it easier to google errors if they eventually happen.

## Your first command
So.. let us walk the walk and talk the talk: let us execute our first command! Let us run a simple program that outputs a text (specified by us) to the terminal. This program is called `echo` and the text we will output will be `Hello world!`. To avoid confusion with commands later in the course, we will place the message between double quotation marks. The command we will type will therefore be:

```
echo "Hello world!"
```

Type this command in your terminal and press enter. Well done! You just stepped into the wonderful world that is called the terminal! There is no way back now. Just kidding, there is (just shut down the terminal for example). But given that you are already here, we can just as well continue right?

## Exercises
Almost every lesson will close with a series of exercises. I recommend you to make all these exercises: they are the best way to test if you truly understood the lesson.

1. Try to execute the same echo command as above, but now 'forget' to type the second quotation mark. What happens?
2. Write a single echo command to output the following to the terminal:

```
100
 42
--- +
142
```
